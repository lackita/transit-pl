=head1 NAME

Data::Transit - Perl implementation of the transit format

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.8.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.8.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Data::Transit;

	my $writer = Data::Transit::writer($fh, 'json');
	$writer->write($value);

	my $reader = Data::Transit::reader('json');
	my $val = $reader->read($value);

For example:

	use Data::Transit;

	my $output;
	open my ($output_fh), '>>', \$output;
	my $writer = Data::Transit::writer($fh, 'json');
	$writer->write(["abc", 12345]);

	my $reader = Data::Transit::reader('json');
	my $vals = $reader->read($output);

Instead of json, you may also provide json-verbose and message-pack;

=head1 Type Mappings

Perl converts a lot of different types into basic strings, and keys in maps have to be strings.  As a result, the only way to fully avoid key collisions is to have some sort of naming scheme, but this violates the spirit of Transit. Put another way, we're accepting the possibility of collisions in exchange for something that maps more closely to idiomatic perl.

In an effort to keep the dependencies of this library to a minimum, any types that correspond to something outside of perls core modules has been excluded. If demand becomes high enough, I will write a separate package to extend heavily into CPAN types.

=head2 Custom Types

Custom types are registered at when the write/read handler is created:

	package Point;

	sub new {
		my ($class, $x, $y) = @_;
		return bless {x => $x, y => $y}, $class;
	}

	package PointWriteHandler;

	sub new {
		my ($class, $verbose) = @_;
		return bless {verbose => $verbose}, $class;
	}

	sub tag {
		return 'point';
	}

	sub rep {
		my ($self, $p) = @_;
		return [$p->{x},$p->{y}] if $self->{verbose};
		return "$p->{x},$p->{y}";
	}

	sub stringRep {
		return undef;
	}

	sub getVerboseHandler {
		return __PACKAGE__->new(1);
	}

	package PointReadHandler;

	sub new {
		my ($class, $verbose) = @_;
		return bless {
			verbose => $verbose,
		}, $class;
	}

	sub fromRep {
		my ($self, $rep) = @_;
		return Point->new(@$rep) if $self->{verbose};
		return Point->new(split /,/,$rep);
	}

	sub getVerboseHandler {
		return __PACKAGE__->new(1);
	}

	package main;

	my $point = Point->new(2,3);

	my $output;
	open my ($output_fh), '>>', \$output;
	Data::Transit::writer("json", $output_fh, handlers => {
		Point => PointWriteHandler->new(),
	})->write($point);

	my $result = Data::Transit::reader("json", handlers => {
		point => PointReadHandler->new(),
	})->read($output);

	is_deeply($point, $result);# true

=cut

sub reader {
	my ($format, %args) = @_;
	return Data::Transit::Reader::JSON->new(%args) if $format eq 'json';
	return Data::Transit::Reader::JSONVerbose->new(%args) if $format eq 'json-verbose';
	return Data::Transit::Reader::MessagePack->new(%args) if $format eq 'message-pack';
	confess "unknown reader format: $format";
}

sub writer {
	my ($format, $output, %args) = @_;
	return Data::Transit::Writer::JSON->new($output, %args) if $format eq 'json';
	return Data::Transit::Writer::JSONVerbose->new($output, %args) if $format eq 'json-verbose';
	return Data::Transit::Writer::MessagePack->new($output, %args) if $format eq 'message-pack';
	confess "unknown writer format: $format";
